# Token.sol
# Project Title
Minting and burn token

## Description

This code defines a Solidity contract named "MyToken" that represents a simple token system. The contract has three public variables: tokenname, tokenAbbrv, and totalSupply. It also has a mapping variable named balances that maps addresses to uints, representing the balance of each address.

The contract has two functions: mint and burn. The mint function increases the totalSupply and the balance of a particular address by a specified amount of tokens. The burn function decreases the totalSupply and the balance of a particular address by a specified amount of tokens, but only if the balance of the address is greater than or equal to the specified amount.
